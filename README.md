Time Series Analysis With Cryptocurrency Project Using Power BI

Welcome to the Time Series Analysis With Cryptocurrency project! In this project, we analyze cryptocurrency market data to identify trends, patterns, and key insights. Utilizing Power BI, we transform, clean, and visualize data, creating interactive dashboards and reports that facilitate strategic decision-making.

Project Overview:-

This project focuses on analyzing cryptocurrency time series data using Power BI. By leveraging Power BI's data transformation, visualization, and analytical capabilities, we provide meaningful insights into trends, patterns, and key financial metrics related to cryptocurrencies.

Key Achievements:-

1.Data Collection & Preprocessing: Historical cryptocurrency trade and market data sourced from Binance and other sources.

2.Data Cleaning & Transformation: Utilized Power Query Editor for data cleaning, formatting, and structuring.

3.Time Series Analysis: Examined price trends, volatility, and moving averages to identify patterns.

4.Interactive Dashboards: Developed user-friendly dashboards with insights into price trends, volume analysis, and market movements.

5.KPIs & Advanced Analytics: Implemented key financial metrics such as ROI, Sharpe Ratio, and Moving Averages using DAX.

6.Predictive Insights: Analyzed historical trends to provide forecasts and potential future market movements.

Technologies Used:-

Power BI: For data transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To create advanced calculations and performance metrics.
Power Query Editor: For data transformation and cleaning.


Getting Started
To explore the Time Series Analysis With Cryprocurrency project in Power BI, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:-

Power BI Desktop (latest version)
Kaggle dataset (Cryptocurrency data)


Installation:-

1.Download the Dataset: Obtain the Cryptocurrency dataset from Kaggle. You can download it from the Kaggle Cryptocurrency Dataset.
